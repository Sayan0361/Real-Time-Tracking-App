# Geolocation Tracking with Leaflet Map - Explanation

This code outline describes how to track users' locations in real-time and display them on a map. Here's a beginner-friendly explanation:

## What the Code Does

1. **Checks if the browser can track location**  
   First, it checks if your web browser supports getting the user's GPS location.

2. **Sets up location tracking preferences**  
   - Wants high accuracy (like your phone's GPS)
   - Will wait up to 5 seconds to get the location
   - Won't use old/cached location data

3. **Continuously watches the user's position**  
   Instead of getting the location just once, it keeps tracking as the user moves.

4. **Sends the location to a server**  
   When it gets new coordinates (latitude/longitude), it sends them to a server using a technology called "socket".

5. **Sets up a map**  
   - Creates a map centered at (0,0) (where the equator meets the prime meridian)
   - Uses OpenStreetMap (a free map service)
   - Sets the zoom level to 15 (pretty close-up view)

6. **Tracks all users on the map**  
   - Keeps a list of all markers (the icons showing where users are)
   - When new location data arrives:
     - Moves the map to center on that location
     - If the user already has a marker, moves that marker
     - If not, creates a new marker for them
   - When a user disconnects, removes their marker

## Analogy

Imagine you're playing a multiplayer treasure hunt game:
- The game checks if your phone has GPS (step 1)
- It wants precise location, not just "somewhere in this city" (step 2)
- It keeps updating as you move, not just checking once (step 3)
- It tells the game server where you are (step 4)
- There's a game map showing all players (step 5)
- As players move, their icons move on the map (step 6)
- When players quit, their icons disappear (step 6)

This is essentially what this code does - it tracks multiple users in real-time on a map!
